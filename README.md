## Programs
- Neovim (>= 0.8)
- tmux (3.2a)
- Starship

## Notes
1. Requires nvim >= 0.8. Can use snap to install it where possible. `bob` is also a good option.I am basically just using default LazyVim.
2. I use `Starship` since it offers some nice shell-agnostic features (like git info). Make sure to have `eval "$(starship init bash)"` to use it instead of the default bash stuff.


### Troubleshooting
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed before setting up LazyVim.
- `:checkhealth` is your best friend.
- `:TSUpdate` is also your friend.
